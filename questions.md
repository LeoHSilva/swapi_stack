1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step in your career?

I want to acquire more knowledge and develop my abilities further so that I can eventually become a lead engineer. And I also want to grow together with the company through a long time relationship.

2. What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?

So far, what has really got my attention is the sector in which the company provides services for. As it's very different from my previous positions, which I find more "fun" to learn new perspectives from this product.

3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production?

Yes, for the past five years I've owned up the features that I worked on, so I'd feel confortable, specially going to the point of production.

4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?

I'd say the product itself is something that I'm eager to learn more about. But regarding technology, I would love to learn more in the field of A.I.
